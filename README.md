##Kaleido-snow
###❄️ Inspiration
Nothing is so ubiquitously associated with the holiday season as snow. From the myriad of songs that sing about the reprieve that a warm, toasty fire brings from the cold outdoors to the infinite number of movies that portray the beauty of winter, snow is as much a part of the holidays as anything else.

Unfortunately, global temperature trends over the past few decades have led to less and less snowfall in many parts of the world. Global warming -- the gradual increase in global temperatures due to the injection of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere through industrial processes -- not only threatens to deprive future generations of the joys of winter but also poses an existential threat to many species (including humans) through rising sea levels, intense weather, and loss of habitat.

As such, we were inspired to help combat this issue by creating a fun site that allows users to make their custom snowflakes and then send $DESO to help fight the climate crisis.

###🎨 What it does
We created an online sketch pad that enables even the most artistically challenged of us to make perfectly symmetrical snowflakes of any color.
Once satisfied with your design, you can submit your masterpiece to be cross-referenced with other snowflakes made on our site to guarantee each snowflake is unique.
You can donate to a top climate charity dedicated to preserving the earth's delicate balance. This also posts your creation and donations amount to the blockchain for your friends to see and hopefully remind them of the need for individual action to prevent climate change.

###👷‍♂️ How we built it
The site was built using React. Additionally, we created a Flask backend to cross-reference the hashes of created images to ensure that every snowflake made is unique.

###📐 Challenges we ran into
Getting the image onto DeSo servers was a challenge, as we initially attempted to add non-blockchain-based image URLs to the posts.

###🎅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy to supply a fun way to spread awareness about climate change accessible with fun activities.

###🔥 What we learned
We learned a lot about DeSo. We also learned about some of the google cloud services, i.e., firebase and cloud storage.

###📈 What's next for Kaleido Snow
Hopefully, we can trend on DESO. #Let_it_snow
